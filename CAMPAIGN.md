Campaign banner: <to-be-filled-by-stackup>
Start date: <to-be-filled-by-stackup>
End date: <to-be-filled-by-stackup>

## Description:
<!-- 2 or 3 brief paragraphs on what this campaign will cover, why it is relevant for the learner to learn it, technologies/skills that will be useful to know before starting on this campaign. -->

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the world by storm, allowing creators to tokenize their unique digital assets and sell them as one-of-a-kind collectibles. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of creating your own NFT Minting Fullstack Dapp called PolyAliens using Hardhat, Solidity, and React.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working NFT Minting Dapp that you can customize and deploy to the Polygon Blockchain. So, grab a cup of coffee ☕️ and let's get started!

## Learning Outcomes:
<!-- 3 to 6 brief points on what they can expect to learn in this campaign. -->

* Publish NFT art and metadata to IPFS.
* Deploy smart contracts to Polygon Network.
* Use Hardhat & Metamask.
* Interact with smart contracts using web3.js.
* Build front-end for the NFT minting DApp.
